YouTube is a massive platform where people engage with content and each other. Comments play a big role in this interaction, showing different opinions and feelings. But understanding how people feel about specific things like videos or creators is tough. It's crucial to know this sentiment to see how viewers are reacting and improve content strategies. This project uses advanced NLP methods to analyze YouTube comments and figure out how people feel about different parts of the platform

## Data Exprolation

**Training set shape**: (74681, 4)  
**Validation set shape**: (999, 4)

Initially, the data lacked headers. Therefore, we added column names to enhance comprehension of the dataset:

</p>

- **video_id**: A distinct marker for every comment tweet.
- **entity**: The focal point of interest linked with the comment (e.g., video ID, creator name).
- **sentiment**: The emotional categorization assigned to the comment concerning the specified entity. There are three categories: Positive, Negative, Neutral. Messages unrelated to the entity are classified as Neutral.
- **comment**: The written content of the video remark.

</p>

- Created a new column named 'comment_word_count' to calculate the word count in each comment. Observed that the average word count per comment ranges from 5 to 30.

</p>

- Identified extreme outliers in our data by implementing a condition where the word count exceeds 125. This approach enables us to examine comments with exceptionally high word counts along with their corresponding sentiments. from this analysis, we can understand if there's anything unusual or strange in our data.

## Data Preprocessing

- Created a dictionary that includes all emojis along with their meanings. Additionally, made a dictionary of contractions to prepare the YouTube comments for use in further NLP models.

### Comment Text Processing

Created a preprocessing function with the following tasks by defining regular expressions:

- **Lowercasing**: Converts all text to lowercase to ensure consistency.
  ```python
  lower()
  ```
- **URL Replacement**: Replaces all URLs in the text with the word 'URLâ€™.
  ```python
  r"((http://)[^ ]*|(https://)[^ ]*|( www\.)[^ ]*)"
  ```
- **Emoji Replacement**: Replaces emojis with their meanings (e.g., ðŸ˜Š becomes EMOJIsmiling_face).
- **Special Character Removal**: Removes special characters and non-alphanumeric characters.
  ```python
  "[^a-zA-Z0-9]"
  ```
- **Sequence Reduction**: Reduces sequences of three or more consecutive letters to just two letters (e.g., 'hellooooo' becomes 'helloâ€™).
  ```python
  r"(.)\1\1+"
  r"\1\1"
  ```
- **Contraction Expansion**: Expands contractions (e.g., "don't" becomes "do not").
- **Stopword Removal and Lemmatization**: Removes stopwords (words like 'and', 'the', 'is') and lemmatizes words (reduces them to their base form).


After preprocessing the data, performed Entity Extraction. This involved extracting entities such as persons, products, organizations, and geopolitical entities from YouTube comments to analyze the sentiment associated with each one.

</p>

Now, for sentiment analysis of those extracted entities, we utilized both TextBlob and VADER methods.
- For a simple and easy-to-implement solution for basic sentiment analysis, TextBlob might suffice. 
- However, for analyzing social media text with informal language and emoticons, and for more detailed sentiment analysis, VADER could be a better choice. It's often beneficial to experiment with both methods and evaluate their performance based on the use case. 

After trying both, we found VADER to be the most suitable for our analysis.

## Visualizing Sentiments of Comments

To identify the primary words used per label, a word cloud was generated to visualize the most significant words within the training data.

1. Positive Sentiment

<p align="center">
  <img src = "https://github.com/gentallman/Entity_Level_Sentiment_Analysis_of_YouTube_Comments/assets/78334851/01a34ff3-95dc-4da9-a24c-a287008f3a04" width=600>
</p>

In comments labeled as positive, words like love, game, thank, good, best, amazing and great were commonly used, alongside a diverse range of words conveying positive sentiments.

2. Negative Sentiment

In contrast, negative comments predominantly featured curse words, along with mentions of specific games and industries such as Twitter, Facebook, and dead redemption.

</p>

3. Neutral Sentiment

Neutral comments, on the other hand, have few curse words, same words as before and differed significantly in terms of important words compared to the other sentiment categories like Italy, twitch tv etc.

**Distribution of Comments per Topic and Sentiment**

</p>

Above barplot shows that for games such as ReadDeadRedemption(RDR) and Battelfield has the number of negative comments is the highest while on the other brands the trend is different. Amazon has highest positive comments.
